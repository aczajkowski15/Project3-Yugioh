		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			So you want to play yugioh (or your reading through every thing to grade it) but either way your here to learn how get started playing yugioh. This first thing I would recomend is getting a structure deck from target, walmart, or a local card game shop close to your house for a few bucks that has every thing you need to start playing, even competitively how ever you probably have much luck. Most importantly you can play with your friends that already know how to play as soon as you look through this website.

		<h2>Brief History</h2>
		<p>
			Yugioh is a popular childrens trading card game or tcg for short. However a vast majority of the game is played teenagers and adults. The game is based off a series of shows called Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh GX, Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's etc... Each show adds a big change to how the game works except the original show and GX were the original show was the first of its kind so there is nothing to build off and GX focused primarily on Fusion Monsters which were all ready in the original show. An example of this is in Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's they introduced Syncro summoning, Syncro Monsters, Tunner Monsters, and changed the Fusion Deck to the Extra Deck.

		<h2>How to get started</h2>
		<p>
		A game is played between 2 players each taking turns one after the other. However the player who goes first can't attck and doesn't draw a card on thier first turn. Both players start with 8000 life points. The game is over when 1 players life points reach 0. You loose life points when your opponent attacks you and your monsters with their monsters and vice versa.
